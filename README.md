# Admin-Dashboard
Grid-y and Flex-y take on the admin dashboard.

The project is supposed to immitate an entreprise level / or a corporate intranet admin dashboard. It is filled with interactivity, and psuedo elements. 

The whole goal of this project is to demonstrate my abilities in Grid, and using it alongside other methods such as Flex. It is also meant to test my creativity. 

There were a few setbacks: The tasks were supposed to be color-coded by importance: i.e: red, yellow, orange, and grey. However, this severely affected the look and feel of the site, and I decided that it would take as much effort and time as it took me to create the site - to find a suitable color-scheme (which inevitably includes changing all existing colors). Ditto, css variables would have made things much easier, and the site might even look better than it possibly already is.

However, that is scope creep. I wanted to avoid over-engineering and scope-creep, hence the empty JS file. (Had plans to sort grids as per their priority) - which I nevertheless decided to leave for a separate, JS focused project: A todo app? or something of the likes. 

Regardless, this piece of work may not look as exciting. But I am proud of it.
